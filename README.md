# Vehicle-detection
Due to copyright issues, I did not upload the video that was processed on it, and instead I uploaded a random video.
In this project, any vehicle or person in CCTV videos, or any video is detected by YOLO model and its image is saved by OpenCv library. 
The path to the processed video and the file path where the images are saved are specified in a jason file.
