# Vehicle-detection
Due to copyright issues, I did not upload the video that was processed on it, and instead I uploaded a random video.
In this project, any vehicle or person in the video is detected and its image is saved. 
The path to the processed video and the file path where the images are saved are specified in a jason file.
